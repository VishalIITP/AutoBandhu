# 🚖 AutoBandhu

**AutoBandhu** is a smart autorickshaw scheduling system that increases driver efficiency and enables affordable, flexible ride-sharing for users.

## 🔧 How It Works

- **Driver Assignment**: Drivers select or are assigned a **virtual stand**—no physical location required.
- **Time-Slot Scheduling**: Each driver is assigned a shift based on their average active time in the traditional queue system.
- **Smart Utilization**: During their shift, drivers serve ride requests from the stand. Afterward, they are free to take any bookings across the city.
- **On-Ride Booking**: Riders can join existing or upcoming rides from the same stand, allowing shared trips and reducing costs.

## 🎯 Key Benefits

- ⏱️ **Better Time Utilization**: More rides, less idle time for drivers.
- 📍 **Virtual Stands**: No need for physical infrastructure—stands can exist anywhere.
- 💸 **Shared Savings**: Riders pay less when sharing, while drivers maintain or increase earnings.
